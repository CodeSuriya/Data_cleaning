# Heart Attack Analysis Project  
This project analyzes global heart attack data, focusing on risk factors like alcohol consumption, diabetes, and medication status.  

GLOBAL DATASET :
It contain the more than 5 million rows.
The python notebook give the clear view of the data cleaning .
In the data cleaning process , I need to handle the missing value , changing the column name , changing the appropriate value in the particular column , changing the datatype int to object 
then finally saving the file into CSV format.


NORTH AMERICA DATASET:
In this dataset , we don't have a north america dataset to analysis for the north america continent.
so we want to create these dataset , that's we use the global dataset .
In global dataset have asia , africa, north america , south america , europe . we separate the north america region category to form the new dataset called north america dataset.
After separate the north america region from the global dataset , we need to check all the elements are correctly updated , in case any missing value or NAN values we need to handle it and fill that value.
Then we need to change the region category north america into united state, canada , mexico..... according to the medical research there are large number of heart attack rate is come from north america (united state . so we need to categorize the region value into 75% of region should be united state , 13% of region should be canada , finally 12% of region should be mexico for the analysis.
Next saved the updated dataset into north america dataset for the final work.
